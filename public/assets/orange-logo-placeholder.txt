PLACEHOLDER: Replace this with the actual orange logo PNG file.

The orange logo file should be named "orange-logo.png" and should be:
- A high-resolution PNG (500x500px or larger recommended)
- Have a transparent background
- Feature the Vitamin English School orange logo

Once you have the actual logo file:
1. Save it as "orange-logo.png" in this directory
2. Generate favicon files from it using an online tool or ImageMagick
3. Delete this placeholder file

For now, a temporary orange circle placeholder has been created.
